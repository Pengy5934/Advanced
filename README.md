# Advanced
Repository for all the interwoven coding files I will write during my time in Advanced Coding class.

Project 1:
  Create a 10 X 10 grid that is resizable and will scale to the given grid dimensions.

Project 2:
  Create a Sprite class that will print an animating sprite to the screen.

Project 3:
  Put the sprite in the grid in a GriddedSprite class

Project 4:
  Form the grid into a maze, with walls and end/start boxes. Each box should hold a background image.
